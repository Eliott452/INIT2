    """ The goal here is to create an agent that
    aim to discover and map his environment by using echolocated
    objects as "anchors".
    It should have a behavior loop that ressemble that :
        1)while no new object found :
            1.1) look for a new object, that will serve as an anchor
        2) Make a move that should keep the anchor in the field of view of the robot (i.e. in the 180Â° in
        front of the robot, and not too far away).
        3) Correct his position change using the anchor position
        4) Look for a new object without moving, if one is found : make it the new anchor.
        5) Go back to 2)

    Expected problem is that the robot will sometimes not find a new anchor, and will loop endlessly while
    keeping the old anchor in his FOV.

    Called swing because the robot should swing from one anchor to another like monkey on vines
